# AmazoneWeb_clone
This repository contains a frontend clone of the Amazon homepage developed using HTML5 and CSS3. The project focuses on recreating the visual layout, including the navbar, hero section, product cards, and footer. It helps in understanding page structuring, CSS styling, and layout techniques such as Flexbox.
